## 🚀 Why I Built This

I wanted to challenge myself to build a **modern eCommerce platform** with the latest web technologies. By combining **Next.js, Drizzle, Neon, Better Auth, Zustand, and Stripe**, I aimed to learn how these tools work together to create a **real-world, production-ready application**. My goal was to not only improve my **full-stack development skills**, but also to understand how to integrate authentication, state management, database operations, and payments seamlessly.

## 🛠️ Problems I Solved

* Built the **Add to Cart** function and dedicated **Cart page** from scratch.
* Designed and implemented the **Collection page** independently.
* Created the **Home page** and **Contact page** with custom design.
* Integrated and configured **Stripe payment processing** on my own.

* Configuring and integrating **Stripe payments**.
* Building a **custom Add to Cart function** and a **Favorites page**.
